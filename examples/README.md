# Examples

These scripts are executable research entry points:

- `01_basic_performance.scd` — canonical way to open and run the instrument (reproducible entry point)
- `02_midi_input_validation.scd` — validates MIDI note-on input independently from synthesis (controlled check)

All examples assume a connected MIDI keyboard, consistent with the instrument design.

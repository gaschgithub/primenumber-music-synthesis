## Prime Number–Based Sound Synthesis

This project explores the sonification and musicalization of prime numbers through what I call *prime music*. A custom synthesizer was developed in SuperCollider (sclang) to investigate the structure, behavior, and aesthetic potential of prime numbers in sound and music.

The system implements **prime spectra** (waveforms built from prime-number harmonics), **prime tuning** (retuning MIDI notes to the nearest prime frequency), and **prime rhythms** generated by numerical counters that trigger events only at prime numbers. These rhythmic processes produce non-repeating temporal structures and are visualized in real time using **Ulam spirals**, revealing geometric patterns in prime distribution.

The resulting instrument integrates synthesis, tuning, rhythm, and visualization into a **MIDI/QWERTY-compatible performance system**, fully implemented in code without external libraries or samples. It was used for composing an electronic music work and as an artistic research exploration of numerical abstraction in sound.

## Quickstart

### Requirements
- SuperCollider
- MIDI keyboard controller or QWERTY Keyboard 

### Running the Gasch Prime Synth

1. Open `src` folder
2. Open `src/GaschPrimeSynth.scd`.
3. Boot the audio server:
   ```supercollider
   s.boot;
   ```
4. Select MIDI or QWERTY mode, writing \midi or \qwerty (line 29 `src/GaschPrimeSynth.scd`)
5. Connect your MIDI keyboard (not if QWERTY keyboard)
6. Execut code block **1) INIT**
7. 8. Execut code block **2) START**
8. Play notes on your keyboard.

### Implementation note

The entry point of the system is `src/GaschPrimeSynth.scd`, which dynamically loads all functional modules from subfolders within `src/`.

## Status

This repository is released as a **research snapshot** corresponding to a
functionally complete version of the Gasch Prime Synth, developed under a
PAPIME-funded artistic research initiative:

**PAPIME 404525 Archivo de prácticas mediales en torno de algoritmias situadas**

**Research snapshot:** `v0.9.0`

Troubleshooting

No sound
- Make sure a MIDI keyboard is connected and detected.
- Ensure the MIDI block has been executed.
- Check that the SuperCollider server is running (`s.boot`).

MIDI not detected
- Evaluate `MIDIClient.init;`
- Verify your device appears in `MIDIClient.sources`.

## Prime Number–Based Sound Synthesis

This project explores the sonification and musicalization of prime numbers through what I call *prime music*. A custom synthesizer was developed in SuperCollider (sclang) to investigate the structure, behavior, and aesthetic potential of prime numbers in sound and music.

The system implements **prime spectra** (waveforms built from prime-number harmonics), **prime tuning** (retuning MIDI notes to the nearest prime frequency), and **prime rhythms** generated by numerical counters that trigger events only at prime numbers. These rhythmic processes produce non-repeating temporal structures and are visualized in real time using **Ulam spirals**, revealing geometric patterns in prime distribution.

The resulting instrument integrates synthesis, tuning, rhythm, and visualization into a single **MIDI-compatible performance system**, fully implemented in code without external libraries or samples. It was used as the basis for composing an electronic music work and as an artistic research exploration of numerical abstraction in sound.

[Listen to a short audio example](assets/audio/gasch_prime_synth_demo.wav)


## Quickstart

### Requirements
- SuperCollider
- MIDI keyboard or controller (mandatory)

### Running the Gasch Prime Synth

1. Connect your MIDI keyboard before launching SuperCollider.
2. Open `src/GaschPrimeSynth.scd`.
3. Boot the audio server:
   ```supercollider
   s.boot;
4. Execute the code blocks in ascending order:
- BUS – audio routing and output
- PRIME – prime number generation and synthesis logic
- ULAM – Ulam spiral mapping and spatial logic
- MIDI – MIDI input handling (required)
- GUI – graphical user interface
  
5. Play notes on your MIDI keyboard.

### Implementation note

The entry point of the system is `src/GaschPrimeSynth.scd`, which dynamically loads all functional modules from subfolders within `src/`.

Troubleshooting

No sound
- Make sure a MIDI keyboard is connected and detected.
- Ensure the MIDI block has been executed.
- Check that the SuperCollider server is running (`s.boot`).

MIDI not detected
- Evaluate `MIDIClient.init;`
- Verify your device appears in `MIDIClient.sources`.
